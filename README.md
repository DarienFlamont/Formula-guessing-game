# Formula-guessing-game
Created by Juan Barrero, Jashan Thind, and myself

#Info
A simple python formula guessing game with Sample Runs included. Created for CMPT 120, SFU, in Fall of 2014. This project is rough around 
the edges as it was developed during first year and as such might not have the best efficiency/code
